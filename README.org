* org-bookmark-heading.el

** About

This package provides Emacs bookmark support for org-mode.  You can bookmark headings in org-mode files and jump to them using standard Emacs bookmark commands.

It seems like this file should be named =org-bookmark.el=, but a [[https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-orgmode/2008-02/msg00328.html][package]] by that name already exists which lets org-mode links point to Emacs bookmarks, sort-of the reverse of this package.

It also seems like this should be built-in to org-mode...  ;)

** Installation

Add to your init file:         

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(require 'org-bookmark-heading)
#+END_SRC

** Usage

Use the standard Emacs bookmark commands, =C-x r m=, etc.
